Knights of the King's fist
Ravaging the land of worthless clits
Lurking in the mist of dawn
Amidst the catacombs
Like hunters in the dark seeking slaves for the covenant
To be unwilling pawns
Terror cleansing the land of the pure
Terror purging the land of the pure

"Hail the King, our majesty
For honor and impurity
Scorch the Earth of heresy
Defend our true heraldry"

Glistening jewels hidden under the filth of poverty
Laying in wait, dormant, 'til the horde rains down to feed
Creeping within the shadows, they seek out lost souls
Deep in their nightmares, embedded in their bones

They drag them through the dirt
The gravel tears holes in their skin
They grasp them by the hair and haul them to the King
They drag them through the dirt
The time is nigh
While the knights of the Kingdom bring Hell to the Earth
The sinless are sacrificed

"Hail the King, our majesty
For honor and impurity
Scorch the Earth of heresy
Defend our true heraldry"
Beneath the sun and the moon
The knights scour the land
The living trapped like rats
Eternally damned

Glistening jewels hidden under the filth of poverty
Laying in wait, dormant, 'til the horde rains down to feed
Creeping within the shadows, they seek out lost souls
Deep in their nightmares, embedded in their bones

They drag them through the dirt

They grasp them by the hair and haul them to the King
They drag them through the dirt
The time is nigh
While the knights of the Kingdom bring Hell to the Earth
The sinless are sacrificed

The knights bring Hell
The time is nigh

Beneath the sun and the moon
The knights scour the land
The living trapped like rats
Eternally damned
Eternally damned
